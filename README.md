# Difference-Objects-Classes
Classes and objects are fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) tools in Java. These concepts help write reusable and efficient code. While both are closely related, they have distinct purposes in the Java programming language.
	A class is essentially a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of a group of similar objects (GeeksforGeeks, 2025). It outlines what properties, behaviors, and characteristics the objects created from it will have. However, a class by itself does not represent any actual data or occupy memory. The class is a blueprint that contains all the steps and ingredients needed to make a dish, but it is not the dish itself. A class performs no actions or stores values until an object is created. Therefore, no memory is used. For example, a class can be a car. This class might define attributes like make, model, color, and year. The class sets the structure but does not represent any specific car.
	On the other hand, an object is an actual instance of a class. An object is the final product made from the blueprint. When you create an object from a class, memory is used, and the object holds accurate data. The object can perform actions through the class's methods and have unique values for its variables. For example, the car is the class, and a White 2019 Volkswagen Jetta is an object of that class. Another object might be a blue 2025 Honda Accord. Both use the same class structure, but they contain different data. Objects are what bring classes to life. You can create as many objects as needed from one class, and each object will be independent of the others. Each object has its own set of variable values, but they all share the same methods and structure defined in the class. This approach allows for efficient code reuse and better organization.
	Classes and Objects are essential in OOP and Java. They form the basis of organizing complex programs into manageable parts, improving scalability, and maintaining clean, efficient code. (GeeksforGeeks, 2025)
